It's a CRO so your enjoyment will vary depending on what company they are having you provide their services to. I got lucky and work for Eli Lilly and work at their site so it's very calm but I have heard other sites can be just as nice or complete shit show depending on department (even at Lilly), so take that with a grain of salt. The pay is pretty shit, bonus is so low it might as well not even be a bonus. You can't really negotiate higher wages since their model is: higher fresh college grad, give them a couple years experience, they leave for a better role, repeat. 
Great for those just getting into industry with little to no experience with just a bachelor's!!!
But leave after 1-2 years especially if you can learn really useful skills and cross train. 

The Eurofins company culture is pretty cringe. They have you attend live (online) trainings and they assign like 20 of them you are expected to complete by the first 12 months. They have terrible trainings like positivity 1,2,3 where it's just them telling you ""Are you sad? Don't come to work sad then! :))))))"" on top of the weird productivity based trainings that don't really apply since you work at the client site not their labs so you can't make use of anything they say. 

Is it a bad job? No. Is it a long term job? No. Use it for experience then after 1-2 years try to get a nicer role around an RA 1-2 Level with a nice benefits and pay bump.

Advancing your career here is extremely slow. Promotions are rare and often insignificant, typically taking 4+ years. GSK invented “title promotions” which are ridiculous and is not considered a promotion but still can take years to graduate from Associate Scientist to Senior Associate Scientist for a 4% raise. Changing grade levels for a promotion takes even longer and is rare. High performance alone isn’t enough to move up; you usually need to apply and interview for higher roles.

While awards are given out, their value is minimal. Equity isn’t granted until Associate Director level, meaning most employees aren’t rewarded for strong performance. The PTO policy is abysmal—just 15 days until you hit 10 years of service, at which point you get a mere 5 extra days. Associate Director level gets an extra 5 days at 5 years of service and another 5 more at 10 years of continued service for 25 days off. Absurd. 

That said, there are some strong benefits: 18 weeks of parental leave is excellent, and the 11% 401(k) contribution is generous. However, overall compensation is average for big pharma.
